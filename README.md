How to play:

CSS has 141 colours pre-specified by name. It is your goal to name as many as you can in 141 seconds.
First press start, then start typing names (no spaces, case insensitive). At the end of the game you will be told how many you have gotten right, and what percantage of the total that is.

This is a website with all the colours, if you would like to prepare: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp
